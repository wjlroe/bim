* DONE More filetypes: Add syntax highlighting rules for some of your
  favourite languages to the HLDB array.
* TODO Line numbers: Display the line number to the left of each line of the
  file.
* TODO Soft indent: If you like using spaces instead of tabs, make the Tab
  key insert spaces instead of \t. You may want Backspace to remove a Tab
  key’s worth of spaces as well.
* TODO Auto indent: When starting a new line, indent it to the same level as
  the previous line.
* TODO Hard-wrap lines: Insert a newline in the text when the user is about
  to type past the end of the screen. Try not to insert the newline where it
  would split up a word.
* TODO Soft-wrap lines: When a line is longer than the screen width, use
  multiple lines on the screen to display it instead of horizontal scrolling.
* TODO Use ncurses: The ncurses library takes care of a lot of the low level
  terminal interaction for you, and makes your program more portable.
* TODO Copy and paste: Give the user a way to select text, and then copy the
  selected text when they press Ctrl-C, and let them paste the copied text
  when they press Ctrl-V.
* TODO Config file: Have kilo read a config file (maybe named .kilorc) to set
  options that are currently constants, like KILO_TAB_STOP and
  KILO_QUIT_TIMES. Try to make more things configurable.
* TODO Modal editing: If you like vim, make kilo work more like vim by
  letting the user press i for “insert mode” and then press Escape to go
  back to “normal mode”. Then start adding all your favourite vim commands,
  starting with the basic movement commands (hjkl).
* TODO Multiple buffers: Allow having multiple files open at once, and have
  some way of switching between them.

## GUI

* DONE gfx (gfx_device_gl) is broken on resize. It calls glViewport with the
  CLOSED: [2019-02-04 Mon 22:50]
  original window dimensions rather than new ones. Try to update gfx libraries.
